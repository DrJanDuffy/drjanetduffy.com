				<h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Which Las Vegas Military Installations Do We Serve?</h2>
				
				<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
					Las Vegas is home to several major military installations including Nellis Air Force Base in North Las Vegas, Creech Air Force Base in Indian Springs, and Naval Air Station Fallon (with some personnel choosing Las Vegas). Understanding these areas and their proximity to quality housing is essential for military families relocating to the area.
				</p>

				<div class="space-y-6">
					<div>
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Nellis Air Force Base</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
							Nellis Air Force Base, located in North Las Vegas, is one of the area's largest military installations. The base is home to the U.S. Air Force Warfare Center and hosts numerous training exercises and operations. Military families assigned to Nellis have excellent housing options in North Las Vegas, Centennial Hills, and other northern Las Vegas communities.
						</p>
						<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
							North Las Vegas offers affordable housing options with newer construction and good value. Communities like Aliante, Skye Canyon, and Centennial Hills provide excellent options for military families, with commute times to Nellis typically ranging from 15 to 30 minutes. These areas offer family-friendly amenities, good schools, and convenient access to base facilities. Properties in these areas typically range from $300,000 to $800,000, offering excellent value for military families.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Creech Air Force Base</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
							Creech Air Force Base, located in Indian Springs about 45 miles northwest of Las Vegas, serves as a major drone operations center. Military families assigned to Creech often choose to live in Las Vegas or nearby communities, commuting to the base daily.
						</p>
						<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
							For Creech personnel, communities in northwest Las Vegas, including Centennial Hills and Skye Canyon, offer convenient access with commute times typically under an hour. These areas provide excellent housing options, good schools, and family amenities. Some families also choose to live in Las Vegas proper, accepting a longer commute for access to more amenities and housing options.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Naval Air Station Fallon</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
							While not in Las Vegas, Naval Air Station Fallon is located about 60 miles east of Reno, and some personnel choose to live in Las Vegas for its amenities and housing options. The drive from Las Vegas to Fallon is approximately 7 hours, making it less practical for daily commutes but potentially viable for some situations.
						</p>
						<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
							For families considering Las Vegas while assigned to Fallon, we can help evaluate the feasibility and explore housing options that might work for your specific situation. We understand the unique challenges of military assignments and can provide guidance on housing decisions that work for your family.
