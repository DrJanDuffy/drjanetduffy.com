				<div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-8 shadow-lg border border-gray-100">
					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How Much Down Payment Do I Need as a First-Time Buyer?</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						First-time buyers can qualify for FHA loans with just 3.5% down payment (with credit score 580+), or conventional loans with 3-5% down. Nevada also offers down payment assistance programs that can reduce or eliminate your down payment. For a $300,000 home, this means $10,500-$15,000 down instead of the traditional 20% ($60,000).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-8 shadow-lg border border-gray-100">
					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What Credit Score Do I Need to Buy My First Home?</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						FHA loans accept credit scores as low as 580 (or 500 with 10% down), making them ideal for first-time buyers. Conventional loans typically require 620+, while VA loans have no minimum but lenders prefer 620+. First-time buyers with lower scores should focus on improving credit before applying, as higher scores qualify for better rates and lower down payments.

				<div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-8 shadow-lg border border-gray-100">
					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Are There Grants or Assistance Programs for First-Time Buyers?</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						Yes, Nevada offers several down payment assistance programs for first-time buyers including the Home Is Possible program, which provides up to 5% of the loan amount in assistance. These programs often combine with FHA loans to make homeownership more accessible. I can help you identify and apply for programs you qualify for.
