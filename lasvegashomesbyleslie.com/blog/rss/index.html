Ultimate Guide to 55+ Communities in Las Vegas: Active Adult Living at Its Finest





You already know Las Vegas for its vibrant nightlife and upscale dining and shopping, but you may not know that Las Vegas is also an exceptional option for those thinking about or approaching retirement. In fact, Las Vegas ranked No. 65 on U.S. News and World Reportâs 2024 Best Places to Retire list, a compendium of 150 cities across the country where retirees thrive. In the following guide to Las Vegas Retirement Communities covers:




Reasons to Retire in Las Vegas


Questions to Consider When Looking for the Perfect 55+ Community


2025-2024 Price Comparisons for 55+ Communities


Is An Active Adult Community the Right Choice for You?




Why Retire in Las Vegas?


Las Vegas has become increasingly popular as a 55+ retirement destination in the past few years. The very definition of retirement has changed for most people. No longer are 55+ adults necessarily downsizing, and many arenât really retiring; theyâre simply changing their focus to new opportunities. Lower real estate prices are especially favorable for anyone considering a move from another state. But prices aside, theres plenty of other reasons to retire in Las Vegas:


The weatherÂ the idyllic climate in Las VegasÂ supports a year-round active lifestyle, with winterÂ temperatures in the 60- to 70-degree range and hot, dry summers. Spring and fall offerÂ moderate temps and mostly sunny skies.


Nevada is a tax-friendly state, especially for retirees.Â  With no state income tax, you wonât be taxed for withdrawalsÂ from retirement plans or pensions. You wonât be taxed on retirement income or anyÂ post-retirement earnings. In addition, property taxes are among the lowest in the U.S., makingÂ your real estate dollar go farther.


So much to doÂ While there are plenty of options for taking it easy in Las Vegas, there are even more options for staying busy and having fun. If youâre thinking of starting a second career, youâll find the infrastructure and market potential to get up and running. Want to go back to school? The University of Nevada at Las Vegas is at your doorstep. Want to get in shape? Youâll find year-round hiking and nature trails, water activities, off-roading and adventure sports, rock climbing and canyoneering, horseback riding, cycling, and golf.


Now, more and more, were seeing the developers of active adult communities setting the bar high for recreation facilities and amenities.


For instance, Del Webb at Lake Las Vegas features a gated community, huge clubhouse with fitness center, pools, tennis and pickle ball courts, golf, and an extensive calendar of activities. All of this set around a 320-acre manmade lake. It doesnt get much better than that.





Buying a home in a Las Vegas retirement community is a good investment as well as providing a convenient and low-maintenance lifestyle. Golf communities in the Las Vegas areas are also a popular destination for retirees, however they arent necessarily age restricted. The blog post, Golf Where You Live in Las Vegas outlines some of the most popular golf course communities in Las Vegas and Henderson with average selling prices.


Lifestyle and Entertainment for Active Adults in Las Vegas


Of course, the world-famous Strip offers nightclubs, casinos, concerts, sporting events and other incredible diversions. However, just beyond the lights youâll find arts and culture at UNLV and at the five-acre Smith Center for the Performing Arts. Experience outdoor adventuring at Lake Mead, Red Rock Canyon, Spring Mountain Ranch State Park, and Valley of Fire State Park.


In addition, there are always conferences and festivals of all kinds happening in the area, including the Las Vegas Food amp; Wine Festival and the annual Las Vegas Book Festival. Whatever your hobbies and passions, youâll find a home for them in Las Vegas.





Healthcare and Senior Services


Peace of mind at your doorstep From preventative care to specialized treatment and long-term health management, the Las Vegas metro offers a strong healthcare network and senior services including in-home care, assisted living and wellness programs. Highly rated hospitals include the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, and Southern HIlls Hospital.


Luxury 55+ Communities: High-End Real Estate for Discerning Buyers


The old-fashioned model of retirement living often included downsizing by moving into a smaller space and giving up many of the amenities and features youâre used to, but thatâs a thing of the past. Many 55+ communities feature luxurious homes of all sizes with high-end amenities that make everyday an adventure. With the number of Americans over 65 doubling in the next 40 years, according to data projections from The Urban Institute, both demand and home values are poised to grow in the sector.


What to Look for in a Las Vegas 55+ Community


To start your search, hone in on what features are important to you by considering the answers to the following 10 questions. Following this, is a concise list of popular 55+ communities with pricing.




What kind of lifestyle do I want: a quiet retreat, an active social scene, or a resort style community?


What kind of location do I want: one thatâs close to family, friends, healthcare, entertainment?


What types of amenities matter most to me: golf courses, pools, fitness centers, walking trails, social clubs, planned activities?


What is the vibe of the community: welcoming, comfortable, social, private, exclusive?


What are the housing options (single-family, condominium, townhome) and is the layout functional and accessible?


What are the HOA fees and do they cover landscaping, security, and community maintenance?


What are the rules and restrictions on guests, pets, home modifications, and rentals?


Is healthcare easily accessible with nearby hospitals, specialists, pharmacies, and community wellness programs or assisted living options if needed?


Is the community financially stable and well-maintained with a solid financial reserve and no upcoming special assessments?


Will I be happy here in 5, 10 or 20 years, or will I need to make other arrangements to accommodate my needs as I age?

Is an Active Adult Community the Right Choice for You?


Ultimately, only you can decide where you want to live and whether an active adult community is the right option. Think about your vision for the future, both in the near term and long term, and consider:




Do you like socializing with others or do you prefer a quieter, more independent lifestyle?


Are you focused on amenities and activities?


Do you plan to spend much of your time traveling or welcoming guests to your home?


Do you want to avoid maintenance or do you plan to spend your days gardening and working around the house?

Discover Why Boulder City is a Top Choice for Relocation


If youre planning on relocating to the Las Vegas area but youre not sure what location to set your sights on, consider buying a home in Boulder City, NV. This particular community offers a small-town charm along with a rich history related to the Hoover Dam, which effectively placed this city on the map. On top of this, many homes for sale in Boulder City have fabulous lake views, and with just a quick drive, residents can enjoy boating, fishing, and other lake activities all year-round.


Located about 40 minutes from the Las Vegas Strip, Boulder City sits far enough away to escape the crowds, daily hustle and bustle, and bright lights, yet close enough to easily head out to the Strip for dinner and a show.


Its also worth mentioning that although Boulder City caters to a wide age range, youll find that with its relaxing slow pace, home affordability factor, and no state income tax, it turns out to be a perfect location for those who are retired.


If this area of Las Vegas has caught your attention, then dive into the three sections below that cover interesting historical facts, amenities in the area, and, of course, information on Boulder City real estate.




Boulder Citys Rich History


A Look at Boulder Citys Amenities amp; Local Activities


Exploring Homes for Sale in Boulder City




Boulder Citys Rich History â The Making of an Iconic Nevada Community


This city has a history unlike any other location in the Las Vegas area, so its worth briefly covering. Its story starts with the fact that the Colorado River, which had flowed uninterrupted for years, was unpredictable, often causing flooding that damaged nearby farmlands. Because of this, the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 approved the construction of a dam, which began in 1931. This dam would not only control the flooding but would also provide much-needed electricity to the Western states. Eventually, it was dubbed The Hoover Dam, named after Herbert Hoover and his role in the project.





The project was run and paid for by the federal government which built an entire city from scratch to house the workers; the area took on the name Boulder City. They constructed homes, as well as built stores, a gas station, and so on.


Building the dam was such a vast project that the government felt the need to carefully control the workers to keep things on track. The tight rein they placed on the workers included no gambling or alcohol. They were able to enforce these laws by declaring the city a federal reservation, where state laws wouldnt apply, similar to how an Indian reservation operates.


This enabled them to outlaw casinos and bars within Boulder City. They even went as far as controlling who could enter and leave the city gates. Even though the governments control tactics seemed a bit extreme, it resulted in the dams construction being completed in 1936, two years ahead of schedule.


After the Hoover Dam was fully functional, the government had planned on demolishing the city. However, the residents loved this new area to the point where they felt compelled to offer to purchase their homes from the government.


Years later, in 1960, Boulder City was incorporated and was no longer government-owned and operated. The city continued to grow and flourish, while sticking to some of its traditional values and original laws, such as a ban on gambling, which the locals seem to appreciate.


A Look at Boulder Citys Amenities and Local Activities


The most well-known element of Boulder City is, of course, the Hoover Dam. Those who live in the area frequently visit this historical icon, and often bring their guests from out of town for a tour.


The dam is gigantic and breathtaking in person, and it offers several interesting museums that cover its origins and construction. The best part of the Hoover Dam would be the fantastic views that are seen while walking or driving over the dam itself. Its also worth visiting the Mike OCallaghanâPat Tillman Memorial Bridge that sits right alongside the dam, which provides one of the best overhead views.


Now, lets talk about the amenity that home buyers are most attracted to within Boulder City, which is directly related to the dam, and that would be Lake Mead.


Lake Mead â Providing Residents with Outdoor Recreation and Scenic Views


The Boulder City real estate market is known for its relation to Lake Mead, and thats because many homes in the area have a beautiful lake view. On top of this, theres a wide variety of recreational water sports and leisurely activities that can be experienced year-round with Lake Mead in the vicinity.





Id like to mention that those who live in the area recommend that new residents visit the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Youll find that its a great place to start your adventure, complete with a visitor center where you can get a few recommendations and grab a map or brochure. The visitors center even houses a museum and gift shop thats worth checking out.


Before we move forward, if you would like insider information, know that you can always reach out to me, Leslie Hoke, at Homes By Leslie. Im a longtime Las Vegas resident and realtor who can fill you in on the areas amenities. This can help provide you with a better idea if Boulder City is a good fit when it comes to your relocation goals.


Enjoy a Day on the Lake with Friends and Family


If you buy a house in Boulder City and also appreciate going out on a boat often, then youre really going to value living here. Even if you dont own a boat, you can still set sail on Lake Mead by simply renting one. There are boats available for every personality and speed preference, such as pontoon boats, fishing boats, small boats, as well as large houseboats.


Do you enjoy canoeing, kayaking, or paddleboarding? If so, youll also find rentals for those, too. In addition to all this, there are Lake Mead cruises available which include scenic dinner cruises, a three-level Mississippi paddle wheelership, as well as private charter tours.


Future residents of Boulder City who love to cast a reel, youll soon realize that Lake Mead is a hot spot for year-round fishing. Locals frequently catch striped bass, rainbow trout, sunfish, and others. Those who are more into watching the fish swim about can grab their scuba gear and head over to North Boulder Beach on Lake Mead, Gypsum Reefs-Virgin Basin, and Cathedral Cove, which provide a range of depths and submerge sites for beginners and advanced divers.


Â 


If you enjoy living near the water, but youre not sure you want to buy a home in Boulder City, I recommend exploring real estate within the three Las Vegas lakefront communities below:




Real Estate Within The Lakes â Luxury Waterfront Properties


Desert Shores Real Estate â A Master Planned Lakefront Community


Lake Las Vegas Homes for Sale â Resort-Style Living at its Best




For those who are campers at heart, know that the locals often spend a few days at a time at the lake by taking advantage of the multiple campgrounds and RV parks that are available. If youre interested, I have a Las Vegas Homes For Sale with RV ParkingÂ blog section that you can immerse yourself in when you have the time.


Parks and Trails â Exploring Boulder City Local Favorites


Anyone considering moving to the Las Vegas area, and looking for a location that offers a chance to spend time out in nature, should place Boulder City high on their relocation list. Why? Because this city offers residents several beautiful parks, as well as a multitude of great hiking trails.


Parks Designed for Family Fun and Relaxation


There are well-maintained parks throughout Boulder City where you and your family can spend time together, hold a birthday party, kick a ball around, basically, enjoying the fresh air, sunshine, and scenic views.


One park worth highlighting is ABC Park, which features a playground, basketball and pickleball courts, an art center, weight room, gymnasium, and youth center. The park is also conveniently located next to the Boulder City Library.


Theres another park thats actually the talk of the town, and this would be Hemenway Park. This is where youll get a glimpse of more than a few big horn sheep that often wander down to graze.


Veterans Memorial Park is another great place that residents frequently visit and hang out. It features a playground, splash pad, sports fields, and a BMX trail. Theres also Wilbur Square Park, which is one of the original Boulder City parks created while the Hoover Dam was under construction.


Hitting the Trails â Hiking within Boulder City


If you enjoy going out on a stroll or even hitting the trails for a good hike, then youre going to love relocating to Boulder City. Theres something for every level and some unique trails that can make things a bit more interesting â lets take a look at a few crowd favorites.


Ill start with the Historic Railroad Trail that sits within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. This is considered a fairly easy hike that sports amazing views of the lake. The trail leads you through several abandoned tunnels that were used during the construction era of the Hoover Dam.


Anyone wanting to pick up the pace a bit, Owl Canyon, which is considered a moderate hike, is a beautiful location to spend quality time. At one point, this area was submerged underneath Lake Mead, but as the water levels dropped, locals began using it for recreation. The rocks that form the trails feature sensational colors, creating a hot spot for photographers as well.





Hikers who like a challenge should jump on the Goldstrike Canyon trail, which travels through a breathtaking canyon where the hiker can get a glimpse of a few natural hot springs. The Colorado River, as well as the Hoover Dam, are within viewing distance while on this trail, which makes for a scenic hike.


Golf Courses â Hitting the Greens in the Las Vegas Area


For those golf enthusiasts out there who would like to make sure theres at least one golf course in the area, youll be happy to know that there are actually a few in Boulder City. This includes the Boulder City Municipal Golf Course, which sports a traditional layout and has homes lining the course. Theres also Cascata Golf Club, where every hole is carved into a mountain, as well as Boulder Creek Golf Club, which is divided into three nine-hole courses â Desert Hawk, Coyote Run, and Eldorado Valley.


You can explore other golf communities in the surrounding area by heading over to our Las Vegas Golf Community HomesÂ section.


The Boulder City Historic District â Shopping, Dining amp; Sightseeing


This is a charming and interesting section of Boulder City that locals frequently visit. Its history dates back to the early 1930s and was originally created for the workers who resided in the area while the Hoover Dam was under construction. That said, youll find many buildings that still remain from that time period.


The most notable vintage structure is the Boulder Dam Hotel, which houses a museum and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition to this, theres a multitude of antique stores, as well as family-owned and operated restaurants and boutique shops. Youll also be able to shop and dine outside of the historic district, as there are many mainstream retailers and restaurants to choose from.


Nearby is Tom Devlins Monster Museum, which is a must-see. It specializes in preserving the art and history of movie special makeup effects and includes real screen-used props and creature suits.


Those who live in the area can plan a fun experience by visiting the Rail Explorers, where you ride out on pedal cars on a 4-mile stretch of railway track, with the ride heading back taking place on an actual train. They also have a neon lights tour during the evening, which is worth experiencing. The Rail Explorers is outside the Historic District, but nearby.


As you can see, theres a whole host of fun, interesting, and exciting things to do in Boulder City that make living there rewarding. However, if youre not sure Boulder City is your cup of tea, and youre just exploring the Las Vegas area real estate scene, then I encourage you to take a moment to read the following post â Moving to Las Vegas? Your Guide to the Best Communities in the Area.

If buying a home in Boulder City sounds like an attractive option, youll want to dive into this next section that covers neighborhoods and property types â from luxury estates overlooking Lake Mead, to condos and houses offering scenic views throughout the city.





The historic city features a mix of renovated older houses, as well as some homes that were rebuilt from the ground up. You can easily start your home search by heading over to my New Listings for Boulder City Homes for Sale page, which will give you a good idea of whats offered in this location.


I mentioned above that this particular city is a perfect location for anyone whos retired. If youre looking for a retirement community, but havent decided if you want to buy a home in Boulder City just yet, feel free to explore this guide I put together on 55+ Communities in Las Vegas.


Buying a Home in Boulder City with a Lake View


When it comes to properties in Boulder City, youll see quite a few listings for beautiful homes with fabulous lake views. These homes are spread across the hills overlooking Lake Mead, with many of them custom-built properties.


You can browse through my Boulder City Real Estate Listings page, where youll find these lake view properties. Be sure to view the higher-end homes as well, since theyre more likely to have the best view of the lake. Neighborhoods surrounding Lake Mead include Lake Terrace, Lake Mead View Estates, Vista del Lago, and Marina Highlands, just to name a few.


You may also notice that although there are houses with lake views, you wont see listings for real estate located on the waters edge. The reason for this is that the Bureau of Land Management owns the land directly surrounding Lake Mead. That said, if your heart is set on buying a home on the water as opposed to having a lake view only, then head over to our Lakefront Communities in the Las Vegas Area page, where you can sort through the waterfront property listings that are available. You can also read more in detail about the specific lake communities themselves by visiting my latest post âÂ Discovering the Top Lake Communities in Las Vegas.


Boulder City Golf Community Homes

Boulder City Municipal Golf Course and Boulder Creek Golf Club are the perfect place to start your search, with homes either lining the course or perfectly situated nearby.

Buying a Home Within the Historic District


The Historic District I discussed above was not just designed for an afternoon out dining, shopping, and running errands; its also a place to reside that features multiple neighborhoods and homes. Many of these are older homes that were remodeled or include add-ons, with some houses completely rebuilt.


Because a good number of the properties were constructed when Boulder City was first placed on the map, the neighborhoods have a lot of charm and character. In addition to this, the streets are lined with trees, and the yards are well-maintained.


Its a fabulous location to live because its just a short, convenient walk to local restaurants, shops, and great entertainment. If youre interested in buying a house in Boulder City within the Historic District, contact Homes By LeslieÂ to find out whats available at this time.

            <description> <![CDATA[ 
Â 





Late Summer Las Vegas Market Report for July amp; August 2025


In our last market update, we talked about the shift we were seeing to a more balanced market, one marked by rising inventory, more predictable pricing patterns and slower sales processes. That shift has been good news for buyers without putting too much pressure on sellers. If Part 1 of this summerâs update captured the marketâs resilience, Part 2 tells a story of how itâs recalibrating. July and August brought steadier prices, along with a clear shift in supply and demand dynamics.


Here is a quick summary of topics we cover in this article:




Home Prices High But Holding


Condo Prices Take a Dip


Inventory Surges


Days on Market Lengthen


Cash and Distressed Sales


Interest Rates Impact


What Does it All Mean for You?


The Big Picture




Home Prices: High But Holding


July saw the median price of a single-family home land at $485,000, tying the all-time record. By August, that number eased slightly to $480,000, still up 0.7 percent from last summer, but just below the peak.


July/August Home Prices

Condo Prices Take a Dip


Condo and townhome values wobbled in the opposite direction. After slipping to $290,000 in July (a -3 percent dip year-over-year), the median price rebounded in August to $298,000, a +1 percent gain compared to 2024. That quick rebound could mean that relative affordability may be drawing buyers back into that segment.


The condo market is an interesting one to watch, since it holds appeal for the two groups most impacted by the market conditions of the past few years â first-time buyers frustrated by low inventory and high interest rates and downsizing seniors waiting for the market to peak before cashing out the equity in their large family homes.

July / August 2025 Condo Prices





View all condos for sale in Las Vegas


The takeaway? Prices arenât swinging wildly; theyâre holding steady near historic highs. That means stability rather than volatility, which is good news for the long-term health of the Las Vegas real estate market.


If this leveling reduces the urgency with which buyers jump back into the market, it could help to mitigate some of the frustration and hysteria that attended the pandemic-era housing market, allowing both buyers and sellers to make better decisions for their long-term gain.



Sales Pace Slows


While inventory builds, sales have cooled. In July, closings for single-family homes were down 5.8 percent from 2024, and condos/townhomes fell 11.6 percent.


August deepened the slowdown, with sales dropping 14.2 percent for homes and 15.4 percent for condos and townhomes year-over-year.



Inventory Surges


The more striking storyline this summer has been the surge in available homes. By the end of July, single-family listings without offers hit 7,147âa 54 percent increase over last year.





Â 


Â Condo and townhome listings grew even faster, soaring 77 percent to 2,622.






Inventory Levels


The region now sits at more than four months of housing supply â double the level of last summer. For buyers, that shift translates into more negotiating power, especially around seller concessions at closing, home repairs or more favorable terms.


For sellers, this means pricing and preparation are more important than ever. Decluttering, neutralizing, staging â all of these are newly important, especially for sellers who are looking for a quick closing due to relocation or life changes.



Days on Market Lengthen


Another sign of a cooler market: Homes are taking longer to sell. In July, 56 percent of single-family homes went under contract in 30 days or less, compared to nearly 70 percent a year ago. By August, that share slipped to 54 percent.


Condos tracked a similar trend, with less than half selling inside of 30 days in both July and August, down from 61 percent last year.


Carrying, home repair and staging costs should be taken into account when pricing. Going for top price in a neighborhood may not be worthwhile if it means month-after-month of expenses prior to closing. Sellers should assume a longer sales cycle and plan accordingly. Those properties that do sell quickly are generally those that are priced correctly at the outset and prepped for maximum buyer appeal.






Cash and Distressed Sales Down


Cash buyers remain active, though not dominant. Roughly 24 percent of July closings and 23 percent of August closings were all cash â far below the investor-heavy days of 2013, when nearly 60 percent of sales required no financing.


Distressed sales barely register, making up less than 1 percent of all activity this summer. According to Las Vegas Realtors, short sales and foreclosures combined made up only 0.5 percent of all existing local property sales in August. That speaks to the stability of the current market and the amount of equity most homeowners have in their properties.



Interest Rate Impacts on the Las Vegas Housing Market





Due to weaker than anticipated jobs reports and report revisions, interest rates fell throughout the latter part of the summer. That helped to improve affordability as home prices either held steady or slowed their growth at the same time, lowering monthly payments.


Expert opinions vary on where mortgage rates will land in 2026, with Fannie Mae forecasting a fall below 6 percent by the end of next year and the Mortgage Bankers Association projecting a steady 6.4 percent holding pattern throughout 2026. Much of the forecast depends on inflation, unemployment and GDP growth throughout the end of 2025 and the beginning of 2026.


Political pressure is part of the equation since the current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell takes a more cautious approach to rate cuts due to the risks associated with unchecked inflation and rising unemployment. At the same time, Fed Governor Stephen Miran, a Trump appointee, favors steeper rate cuts, something the president has repeatedly called for. Unfortunately, this uncertainty around monetary policy also translates into uncertainty around financial forecasting.



What Does It All Mean for You?


Especially for Buyers





Availability is Up Statistics say that the majority of Gen Z believes theyâll never own a home, and Millennials with growing families feel boxed into their starter homes due to lack of inventory and affordability. The good news for these groups is that the tide is finally turning in their favor. With effective single-family home availability up 59.4 percent year over year, and condos up 84.4 percent, buyers have more choice and more leverage than in recent years.


More Motivated Sellers - If youâre looking to buy, keep an eye on days on market to find motivated sellers. They may be more open to concessions, price adjustments or closing cost credits that could make homeownership more affordable than you previously thought possible.


Increased Negotiation Leverage - In addition, take advantage of your increasing negotiating leverage to conduct more thorough home inspections, especially if the home youâre interested in has specialty systems like a pool or smart-home integration. In that case, ask for a specialty inspection (or two) alongside your more comprehensive general inspection.


Due Diligence - If youâre looking for a condominium, use your time to conduct thorough due diligence on the condo association so that you can ensure that they have healthy reserves and a history of responsible property management. In addition, check for looming special assessments to avoid unpleasant surprises (and buyerâs remorse) after closing.


Impact to Sellers





Realistic Pricing - Itâs time to get realistic on both pricing and preparation, to meet the realities of the current market. Because buyers have more choice, they wonât be in as much of a rush and multiple offers may not roll in the first weekend. Price strategically with an eye on your micromarket, based on relevant comps in your area.


Staging Strategy - Work with your agent to develop a strategy for staging, marketing and pricing your property to stand out against the competition. Remember, floating a higher price to âtest the marketâ could result in a chase to the bottom if you overreach and drive away early interest.


Key Points - Because presentation matters more now, consider the following:




Staging helps a home stand out both online and in real life. Donât forget to stage outdoor areas and sell the lifestyle, not just the bricks and mortar.


Marketing with professional photos, video tours, property descriptions and targeted online campaigns helps highlight a propertyâs differentiators. It also provides information about community amenities and convenient proximity to local areas and features of interest.


The condition of the home can be a powerful factor in drawing buyers and their newfound negotiating leverage. Consider a pre-listing home inspection or proactive repairs to provide a smooth on-ramp for the eventual negotiation. Above all, be realistic with pricing and timeline and build flexibility into your plan from the beginning.


Review our article on Home Staging - A Powerful Tool to Achieve Your Goals




For Investors





Motivated Sellers - The best tool in your toolbox is certainty for sellers whoâve been surprised (and not in a good way) by the demands of the shifting market and who are now highly motivated to make a deal. Keep an eye out for listings that were poorly priced out of the gate and that have been sitting on the market for longer than they should have. Watch, too, for segments with high inventory growth, like the condo and townhome segment.


Rescue Properties - If you have the budget for it, focus on properties where deferred maintenance means that the home has not been properly prepared for the preferences of current homebuyers. That suggests either a lack of budget or a lack of willingness to properly position the listing, allowing you to come in with a well-formulated rescue offer.


Cash is Clout Remember, cash buyers no longer dominate the market like they did a few years ago. If you have the ability to buy for cash and close quickly, that could be a powerful differentiator and allow you to stand out from the crowd.


Rental Properties for Long Term Growth - Because rental demand has held steady, you have flexibility and the opportunity to position yourself for long-term growth. More market balance and greater inventory gives you time to make more careful acquisitions and, potentially, increase your margins over time.


Multiple Exit Strategies - Explore multiple exit strategies to allow you to make the most of each acquisition. Differentiating your buy-box among flips, short-term rentals and long-term rentals can help you build your portfolio no matter how the market evolves over the coming months and years.


The Big Picture





Balance is Good - Remember, an unbalanced market offers its own dangers, so while homeowners may long for the fast-paced sellerâs market of years past, the more balanced market weâre seeing coupled with still-steady home prices suggests a move toward normalcy.


More Choice - Because buyers have more inventory to choose from and a bit more bargaining power, theyâre willing to get back into the market. For sellers whoâve felt locked in over the past couple of years, wanting to make a move but afraid that there was nothing out there to choose from, thatâs good news as well.


Mortgage Rates are Key - As we move into a surprisingly active fall market, mortgage rate movements hold the key to what weâll see next. If rates continue to ease, more buyers may come in off the sidelines, especially now that they have more options. That increase in demand could bring with it a new surge in prices and a return to greater bargaining power for sellers.


Slow amp; Steady - The best news to come out of this summer? Steadier conditions benefit the overall health of the Las Vegas housing market and, by extension, the Las Vegas economy. This summerâs slower, more predictable pace reduces risk by avoiding overheated bidding wars, allowing both buyers and sellers the space and time they need to make the best possible decisions. That translates into a healthier and more sustainable market that benefits everyone.

            <description> <![CDATA[ 



Finding Your Dream Home within a Las Vegas Lakefront Community


A surprising number of people dont realize that Las Vegas waterfront properties exist, but they do, and theyre often referred to as a desert oasis. In fact, there are three beautiful lake communities in the Las Vegas area that boast homes on the waters edge. This includes properties with private boat docks and personal shorelines, direct access to the lake, and the ability to enjoy a tranquil, retreat-like lifestyle.


Each lakefront community features beautiful, pristine, sparkling man-made lakes that are well-cared for and stocked with fish each spring. The fact that Las Vegas offers homebuyers three distinct lake neighborhoods makes finding your dream home even easier with more options to match your preferences for community style and scenic surroundings.


At this point, youre probably eager to learn more about these locations that offer lakeside living. That said, dive into the following three sections below that will give you a well-rounded view of each lakeside community:




Lake Las Vegas â Premier Resort-Style Living


The Lakes â Luxury Waterfront Homes in Las Vegas


Desert Shores â Master Planned Lakefront Community




1. Lake Las Vegas â Premier Resort-Style Living


Those seeking out premier waterfront living should consider the Lake Las Vegas area for their new home. Even the Las Vegas Review-Journal recognizes this location as a desirable place to live, as they awarded it Gold Winner status for master planned communities in Southern Nevada. The community is uniquely stylish and beautiful, offers upscale amenities, and provides the opportunity to live a relaxing, yet active, and fun lifestyle. You can take a sneak peek at the real estate available in the area before you continue by heading over to our Homes for Sale in Lake Las Vegas page.


Ok, now lets dig further into the details on what makes this particular lakeside community so high on everyones list.


Amenities That Create a Truly Desirable Living Experience


The amenities within Lake Las Vegas are beyond comparison, with many focused around the pristine lake that draws future residents to this location. This 320-acre man-made lake provides those who live in the area with a vacation or retreat-like feel year-round.





Imagine walking out your front door and easily heading over to the lake for activities such as kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, or electric surfboarding. If you dont have whats needed to enjoy these activities, you can rent them from Lake Las Vegas Water Sports. Youll even be able to rent an electric boat so you can enjoy your own private excursion on the lake. Theres much more to this Las Vegas community than lake activities, though. Lets find out what they are:


Public amp; Exclusive Waterfront Golf Courses in Lake Las Vegas


If you love to hit the greens regularly, youll be happy to know that situated around the lake are two prestigious golf courses â South Shore Country Club, which is private, and Reflection Bay Golf Club, which is open to the public.


SouthShore Country Club is the first private Jack Nicklaus Signature Course in Nevada. This private country club sports an exceptionally designed and well-maintained course, a private sandy beach, and a clubhouse that features a sparkling pool, tennis and pickleball courts, and more. Theres also a state-of-the-art fitness center and a 28,000 sq. ft. clubhouse that houses a restaurant and bar. If youre interested, take a moment to view private golf course homes in the South Shore of Lake Las Vegas.


Reflection Bay is also a lakeside course designed by Jack Nicklaus. Just like SouthShore Country Club, it was designed with a private white sand beach, a clubhouse, and offers casual and fine dining. In addition to this, Reflection Bay boasts unique live performances held on a floating stage over the lake. What makes this particular golf course stand out from the rest is the fact that its home to the High Performance Golf Institute, a well-known golf instruction facility. You can get ahead of the game by checking out the Reflection Bay Golf Homes that are available at this time.


Land Lovers Enjoy Scenic Hiking amp; Biking Trails


If youd rather enjoy the lake while on land, there are plenty of walking spaces, hiking trails, and bike paths with breathtaking views of the water. Youll want to head over to the nearby trail connector at Terrazza Park, which is a great starting place for a morning jog or leisurely stroll.


Lake Las Vegas is known for being a community where residents can stay active within a retreat-like environment. Patrick Parker, president of Raintree Investment Corp., master developer of Lake Las Vegas, makes note of this as he states, Where else can you grab your paddleboard and head out to the lake, hike or ride some of the cityâs best desert trails right from your front door? Whether you want a casual evening stroll with your dogs or an invigorating trail ride after work, there are lots of opportunities to stay fit outdoors at Lake Las Vegas.


Connect with Neighbors at The Lake Las Vegas Sports Club


Those who live in this resort-style lake community will love being a member of the Las Vegas Sports Club. Its an upscale place to gather to not only get active and fit, but also to socialize with neighbors who take part in the events and entertainment thats held there. There are two exceptional pools, tennis and pickleball courts, a variety of classes, a state-of-the-art fitness center, and a studio for personal training. Youll also find a steam room and a game room for children and those who are young at heart.


The MonteLago Village on the Lake


Another amenity that residents enjoy is The MonteLago Village, which is a beautiful re-creation of an authentic Tuscan village. Youll certainly be taken in by the charming cobblestoned streets, Ponte Vecchio-style bridge, and piazzas. Residents also admire the gorgeous view of the lake and picturesque mountain ranges from this vantage point, especially as sunset approaches.





Theres more to the village than a scenic destination, though; it offers up some of the best dining in the area, as well as fabulous shopping opportunities, events, and live entertainment such as the Henderson Symphony on Lake Las Vegas.


When it comes to dining, head over to Mimi amp; Coco Bistro, where youll enjoy a casual French experience. You can also visit the Sonrisa Grill for Mexican-style lake view dining, or one of the many other restaurant options within the village. Also, dont forget that the Las Vegas Strip is only 17 miles away, so youll have even more exceptional restaurants and shops within a short distance.


If you happen to be looking for a low-maintenance vacation home, you can actually own a condo thats located in the MonteLago Village in Lake Las Vegas. Theyre called Luna Di Lusso Condos, and theyre considered a prominent Henderson, NV condo hotel.


Overall, Lake Las Vegas having its own village is a perk that draws residents to this location and provides various levels of year-round entertainment.


Quality Health Care for Local Residents


It may be your dream to live in a waterfront property in Las Vegas, but no matter where you plan on setting your roots down, you should ensure theres quality health care in the vicinity. The good news is that the Lake Las Vegas community has convenient access to area hospitals such as the new Henderson Hospital in Union Village, as well as local physicians and urgent care facilities.


Moving to Lake Las Vegas with Children â Nearby Schools


If this lake community is on your radar and you have kids, youll be happy to know that there are nearby schools for students of all ages â from kindergarten to college. Youll also find specialty schools like the Lake Mead Christian Academy and Signature Preparatory in Henderson, and a K-8 public charter school only 7 miles away within the city of Cadence.







Neighborhoods amp; Homes within Lake Las Vegas


Lake Las Vegas offers upscale waterfront properties with many located within gated communities with exceptional golf course views. For instance, the Lago Vista community boasts modern designs, scenic lake views, and overlooks the Reflection Bay Golf Course. In addition to this, Lago Vista provides private docks with access to a private beach with cabanas. As you can imagine, homes such as these, in such a desirable location, and properties in this community in general, are in high demand, which limits inventory. To view whats available at this time, take a look at our Lake Las Vegas homes for sale section.


All Lake Las Vegas homes are beautifully designed, with many featuring a Mediterranean or Tuscan theme. However, in recent years, builders such as Blue Heron Homes have been shifting towards a more contemporary style, which the community loves as well.


A Variety of Housing Types to Suit Your Needs


No matter what your property preference, youll most likely find it here within this waterfront community. The area has a mix of single-family homes, condos and townhomes, luxury estates, golf villas, and custom-built properties. For those looking for a 55+ community, youll find it within Del Webb at Lake Las Vegas, but overall, anywhere within this resort-style lake community would be absolutely perfect for retirees.


This location also caters to those who are seeking out an investment property, along with anyone wishing to buy a 2nd home. If youre looking into investing in a rental property within Las Vegas, youll be able to gain some insight into the area housing market by heading over to our Investing in Las Vegas Real Estate post.

You can start by diving into the next location, The Lakes, another waterfront community that has much to offer. But first, for those who are on the fence about moving to the area in general, if you need some inspiration, bookmark the following article â Discover Why People Are Moving to Las Vegas.


2. The Lakes â Luxury Waterfront Homes in Las Vegas


The Lakes is a master planned community located in west Las Vegas, just east of Henderson and about 10 minutes from the heart of Summerlin. Over the years, the area has attracted a diverse range of residents, from young families to individuals enjoying a peaceful retirement.





The Lakes community surrounds Lake Sahara, a shimmering 30-acre man-made lake thats only accessible to waterfront area residents and their guests â its a hidden gem within Nevada, and locals love residing there. With that in mind, lets explore the area to find out more about Lake Sahara, The Lakes community in general, the housing market, and the amenities youll enjoy if you move to this popular area of Las Vegas. Anyone wishing to start by gaining more insight into the housing market should head straight over to our real estate within The Lakes listing page.


Top Amenities at The Lakes that Attract Residents


Ill start with what the majority of the residents feel is the most attractive amenity, and that, of course, is Lake Sahara. As mentioned, direct lake access is exclusive to homeowners and their visitors who live within the gated waterfront community. Meanwhile, residents of The Lakes who live outside this gated area are still able to take in the breathtaking lake views. Also, if youre wondering why this location is called The Lakes, when it appears theres only one lake, its because the city had plans to develop a 2nd lake, but halted those plans after deciding one lake was perfect.


If youre contemplating buying a beautiful Las Vegas home on the water within The Lakes, youll be setting yourself up for a resort-like lifestyle. Lake Sahara offers a wide variety of water sports and activities such as paddleboarding, sailboating, cruising on an electric powerboat, and kayaking. Along with this, the lake is stocked with fish so you and your family can enjoy catch-and-release fishing year-round. The highlight of owning a lakefront property in this community is unwinding on your patio while soaking in the stunning lake views, particularly during sunrise and sunset.


Parks amp; Trails with Exceptional Lake and Mountain Scenery


Like most Las Vegas master planned communities, fabulous walking, biking, and hiking trails are incorporated into the landscape. This particular location boasts miles of treelined trails along with parks, with many of them sporting lake and mountain views. Popular parks youll want to visit that feature waterfront scenery are Lake Sahara South and Lake Sahara North Park. In addition to this, youll also find peaceful ponds sprinkled throughout the area.


Lake Town Center Shopping and Dining Accessible by Boat


Although anyone in The Lakes community has access to Lake Town Center, those who own Las Vegas waterfront properties on Lake Sahara are able to travel to this plaza by boat. Residents can conveniently pick up groceries at the mini mart, take care of dry cleaning, or head over to the salon. But one reason the Lake Town Center is so popular is that it has several great eateries, like The Lakes Lounge and Gaming Bar, a 24-hour restaurant that has been serving the community since 1987. Or, for a unique experience, grab a vegetarian dish at the Baby Birds Cafe.


If youd like a wider variety, you can simply drive up the road for more options, such as Frank amp; Finas Cocina, which dishes up authentic Mexican food, or The Ledgends Oysters Bar amp; Grill, a fun and unique place if youre in the mood for seafood, along with a handful of other eateries to sit and enjoy a meal. Or, drive a little further, just under twenty miles, for fine dining and shopping on the Las Vegas Strip.







Places of Interest within The Lakes and Nearby


When you live at The Lakes, theres more to do than spend the afternoon on the water. In fact, there are plenty of options to keep you entertained all within a short driving distance. For instance, you can stop by the Desert Breeze Aquatic Center, as well as the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, which makes for an excellent place to go hiking or even mountain climbing. Also, if you check the Red Rock Canyon events calendar, youll find things like Art in Nature â Paint a Red Rock Canyon Postcard or Connect Through the Lens â Photography Guided Hike. For those who are golf enthusiasts, know that the members-only Canyon Gate Country Club is close by.


This was only a fraction of the activities offered within the area; youll find theres plenty more to uncover at The Lakes when you settle in and start exploring. The Lakes community is also a short distance from downtown Summerlin, which offers a whole host of amenities and outdoor activities as well.


Quality Las Vegas Health Care


Comprehensive health care facilities are nearby, this includes Summerlin Hospital Medical Center, and Swanlake Medical Center. Youll also have specialty medical centers, doctors offices, physical therapy practices, and senior care centers to choose from. The Lakes community is centrally located, so there wouldnt be an issue finding quality health facilities when the need arises.


Quality Public and Private Schools in the Vicinity


For those with children, know that there are a number of reputable schools in the area. This includes elementary, middle, and high school, as well as private Christian and Lutheran schools, all located within the Clark County School District.


Neighborhoods amp; Homes Within The Lakes


The Lakes offers a range of properties to suit various budgets and preferences. For instance, depending upon a buyers budget, theyll have the opportunity to own a luxury lakefront single-family home, or a condo or townhome that also sits on the waters edge. These particular Las Vegas properties line Lake Sahara and are in a beautiful gated neighborhood, with most homes sporting a private dock and shoreline. Also within this gated community are homes that dont line the lake, but instead sit within this neighborhood. And although they dont have their own private shoreline and dock, they do, however, have access to the lake.


You dont have to live within this specific gated lake neighborhood to be a part of The Lakes. Why is this the case? Because The Lakes also includes lovely homes that are not directly lining Lake Sahara. These properties consist of luxury estates, large and small, modest single-family homes, along with affordable condos and townhomes. To get an idea of whats available, whether directly on the shores of Lake Sahara or nearby, take a look at our waterfront home listings within The Lakes by price range.

3. Desert Shores â Master Planned Lakefront Community


In the foothills of northwest Las Vegas, youll find Desert Shores, a private lakefront community that some refer to as a best-kept secret. Desert Shores is located just north of Summerlin, about 28 miles from the Vegas Strip, which is close enough to enjoy the excitement, yet far enough away to return to a tranquil lakeside neighborhood. On top of this, the area offers a family-friendly, community-focused atmosphere, and this is certainly one aspect of Desert Shores that the locals really appreciate.


This master planned community boasts fantastic amenities and diverse housing options, which is a mix that makes for the ideal destination to call home. Now, lets take a look at what this location has to offer, starting with a quick video tour to give you a visual of just how breathtaking the area really is:







Desert Shores Amenities that Create an Exceptional Residential Experience


I referred to Desert Shores as a best-kept secret, and the reason for this is that its a location that many people who live outside of Las Vegas have not heard of. The truth is that Desert Shores is an excellent relocation destination because it offers residents a unique and unexpected oasis-like experience in the middle of the desert. One amenity that makes this a reality is the communitys four pristine man-made lakes, which are Lakes Jacqueline, Sarah, Maddison, and Lindsey.


These lakes are the highlight of Desert Shores and offer a chance to own waterfront property and enjoy a vacation-like lifestyle. All four lakes are worthy of mention, but Ill just focus on the largest of the four, which is Lake Jacqueline.


Lake Jacqueline Provides an Outstanding Waterfront Lifestyle in Las Vegas


Lake Jacqueline isnt just an amenity; its an element that brings this Las Vegas community together. And no matter where you live in Desert Shores, youll have access to this sparkling lake and all it has to offer. For instance, residents can enjoy an afternoon of kayaking, paddleboating or electric boating, year-round, seven days a week. For those who love to spend quality time fishing, know that the lake is stocked with fish each year, with a catch-and-release policy in place.


At the edge of Lake Jacqueline, youll find the Swim Lagoon, which is open during the summer months. Its a 400,000-gallon crystal clear swimming pool designed to resemble a real tropical lagoon, complete with a sandy beach and palm trees. The lagoon is a community favorite thats considered an upscale amenity with a Caribbean resort feel.


Surrounding the lagoon, which is located at Lagoon Beach Park, youll find a basketball court, as well as sand volleyball. There are also picnic pavilions and barbecue grills for those who want to make a day of it. In addition to this, youll see a community clubhouse thats used for special events and can be rented for private parties.


Those who buy a Las Vegas waterfront property in Desert Shores will have access to all these incredible lake amenities. As you can imagine, this is a highly sought-after community, so be sure to take a moment to browse through the Desert Shores properties to see whats currently available.


Picturesque Walking and Biking Paths Surrounding All Four Lakes


Desert Shores offers a chance for residents to get out and enjoy the scenic lake views and fresh air with its series of walkways that loop around the four lakes, which conveniently connects various neighborhoods. If youre up for something more challenging, you can head over to the nearby Red Rock Canyon, where youll be able to take on its hiking trails and enjoy the spectacular views.


Waterfront Dining and Shopping


Las Vegas waterfront properties in Desert Shores come with the perk of easy access to lakeside dining options, and there are many fabulous eateries to choose from. Even if you dont live directly on the water, its still a quick drive to any of the local lakefront restaurants. Located in Lakeside Village, off the shores of Lake Jacqueline, youll find a few of these amazing places to sit and dine by the water. This would include Marche Bacchus French Bistro and Wine Shop, which was awarded the TOP 10 Las Vegas Restaurant. Its fine dining at its best and boasts an exceptional Wine Cellar as well.


In the same location, theres Vino Aromi Italian Bistro amp; Bar, and The Americana, featuring modern American cuisine, and home to the renowned chef, Steven Blandino. For something a bit more casual, theres The Daily Bread, which is open for lunch and breakfast, as well as Buena Vista Kitchen, serving Mexican food youll be sure to love.


These were just a few lakeside dining options, but there are plenty of other restaurants and cafes you can explore throughout the area. If youd like to do some cooking and dine at home, there are nearby grocery stores, and premium grocers such as Whole Foods, Sprouts, and Trader Joes.


As far as shopping is concerned, youll find a variety of charming local mom-and-pop shops, to well-known national retailers. And dont forget, the Vegas Strip is not too far and offers endless shopping opportunities.


Essential Medical Facilities Available to Residents of Desert Shores


Moving to a lake community sounds like an amazing opportunity, but first things first, is there great healthcare in the area? Youll be happy to know that youll have access to top medical facilities if you move to Desert Shores. This includes Mountain View Hospital, Las Vegas Urgent Care, and Summerlin Hospital Medical Center Emergency Room. Along with this, theres a wide array of primary and specialty practices, and dental offices just a few short miles from the Desert Shores community as well.


Clark County Schools Catering to Desert Shores Families


Families thinking about moving to Desert Shores that would like to ensure quality schools are in the area can rest assured knowing there are great schools of all levels that cater to this location. Desert Shores is served by the Clark County School District, which offers access to one of the states most respected educational systems. This includes elementary, middle, and high schools, plus exceptional charter schools such as the Doral Academy of Nevada.


Desert Shores Neighborhoods amp; Homes





Desert Shores boasts beautiful neighborhoods with a variety of housing types â luxury villas, single-family homes, condos, and townhomes. Many homes line the shores of the four lakes, making these Las Vegas waterfront properties highly desirable and so they are often limited in availability.


Overall, there are roughly 3,500 homes standing in this master planned community of Desert Shores, which includes lakefront and non-lakefront properties. Additionally, because the community was developed over a period of time, starting in the late 1980s, theres a blend of housing styles such as contemporary, southwestern, Spanish, and Mediterranean. A good number of these Desert Shores properties sit behind gated communities that have their own governing board, yet still adhere to the Desert Shores master association rules, which keeps the community beautiful and safe.


Las Vegas Waterfront Properties Within the Desert Shores Area


If youre here because youre specifically interested in a Lakefront property, know that this community features resort-style living with direct access to the lake as well as private boat docks. For instance, youll find these features in the upscale gated community of Diamond Bay, which touches the shores of Lake Jacquelin and Lake Maddison. If your interest has been sparked, browse through the listings of the available properties within Diamond Bay. You can also dive into other lakeside subdivisions within Desert Shores below:

            <description> <![CDATA[ 



Deep Dive Into Summer Housing Trends - Part 1: May and June 2025


Understand the latest market trends with Leslie Hokeâs summer real estate market deep dive for the metropolitan Las Vegas area.


This is part 1 of a two-part series on the shifting market. Look for part 2 in September, once final July and August market data is available from Las Vegas Realtors


Here is a quick summary of topics we cover in this article:




How an Inventory Surge is Reshaping the Las Vegas Home Market


May/June Market Snapshot


Inventory Supply and Availability


May/June Sales Activity


Which Strategy is Right for You?




The groundwork for many of our current real estate market challenges was laid more than five years ago at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Far from causing a downturn in the real estate market, as pundits first believed, a combination of work-from-home policies, record-low interest rates and the desire to put down roots in areas outside of high-density population centers led to outsized demand, historically high home values and increasing affordability challenges.


For buyers over the past five years, a combination of higher interest rates, high home prices and low inventory levels has created frustrating conditions, making it tough to find and afford any home, much less that long-sought-after dream home. Now, however, after that long drought, market conditions seem to finally be shifting in favor of buyers.


Sellers need not worry, however, since what weâre seeing is more of a balanced market â one that holds positive potential for both buyers and sellers. To make the most of the opportunity ahead, understanding market realities, focusing on the future and working with an experienced real estate professional allows anyone to craft a winning strategy for a home sale or purchase.


How an Inventory Surge is Reshaping the Las Vegas Home Market


You may have heard of a mortgage-related âlock-in effectâ and its impact on home inventory. Put simply, this describes a situation in which existing homeowners have markedly lower interest rates on their current mortgage than current market rates, resulting in a reluctance to sell their homes and take on a higher-rate mortgage on their new purchase.


When a lock-in effect occurs, we donât see the normal move-up sellers looking for more square footage or a bigger backyard. The people who sell their homes, generally are doing so out of necessity; perhaps due to a work relocation or major life change.


After a while, however, we start to see some pent-up demand, where potential sellers have put off their home sale for so long that they can no longer wait. This inevitable surge in inventory seems to be what weâre seeing in the current market shift.


In May 2025, the number of single-family homes without offers was up a whopping 71.8 percent year over year, with condos up an eye-popping 134 percent over the prior year. In June, the number of single-family homes without offers jumped 70 percent year over year, while the number of condos and townhomes without offers surged 87.6 percent year-over-year. These numbers represent a definite shift from the super-tight low inventory conditions weâve been experiencing until now.



May/June 2025 Las Vegas Market Snapshot





Home Prices are Up, But Stabilizing


Itâs important, however, to note that this increasing inventory has been accompanied by home prices that are still growing, although for less dramatically than in years past. That stability is good news for sellers and reinforces the idea that weâre seeing a shift to a more balanced market rather than a market reversal or correction.


The May 2025, the median price for single-family homes clocked in at $480,000, up 1.5 percent on the year and representing no change from the April price.


The median single-family home price in June 2025 hit $485,000, matching the all-time high from earlier in the year but up only 1 percent on the month. Year over year, that price is up just 2.1 percent, signaling stable prices even amid increasing supply, which is good news for sellers.Â

Â 


May/June 2025 Condo Prices





For condos, the May 2025 median price at $307,000 was up 1.4 percent on the month and 4.1 percent on the year.


In June, the median price of condos was $305,000, down slightly (0.7 percent), but still up 3.4 percent year over year.

Inventory Supply and Availability May/June 2025


How Buyers are (Finally) Gaining Leverage


Housing supply in June was at 3.6 months of effective availability. That represents a 12.8 percent increase month over month and an 82.8 percent increase from June of last year. On the condo front, there were five months of effective availability, which was up 10.9 percent from May and 120.3 percent from June 2024.





At the same time, properties are sitting slightly longer on the market, with only 61.4 percent of single-family homes sold within 30 days in June, down from 71.6 percent a year earlier. Condos saw a similar lag, with only 50.7 percent of homes selling within 30 days, down from 61.5 percent the previous year.


That much supply means that buyers have something they havenât had in a very long time â time itself. Time to negotiate. Time to consider. Time for inspections. Time to work effectively with their lender and their real estate agent. This is no longer the market of blind bidding wars and unlimited price escalations.






Sales Activity May/June 2025


Sales Activity is Softening





Looking across the spectrum of home types, including single-family homes, condos and townhomes, total sales were down nearly 8 percent month over month between May and June. Condos and townhomes saw the bulk of that drop, down 14.9 percent year over year and 7.9 percent from Mayâs pace.


Overall, Mayâs numbers represented sales valued at more than $1.2 billion for single-family homes and more than $182 million for condos and townhomes. Thatâs up 1.2 percent year over year for single-family homes and down 15.7 percent on the year for condos and townhomes.





The total value of real estate sold during June was more than $1.2 billion for single-family homes and $161 million for the condos and townhomes category. On the year, that represents a decline of 2 percent for single-family homes and 16 percent for condos and townhomes.


Focus on Single-Family Home Listings May/June 2025


New listings for single-family homes dropped 9.4 percent month over month in June 2025, even as inventory rose overall. That suggests that sellers are beginning to get cautious after a more active spring, in part, due to homes remaining unsold. The average price of homes sold spiked 7.2 percent month over month to $636,617, signaling that buyers are still willing to pay top dollar for premium luxury and move-in-ready homes.


Focus on Condo amp; Townhome Sales May/June 2025


While prices in this market segment remain below their $315,000 peak from October 2024, median values are up 3.4 percent year over year to $305,000. Sales volume month over month was down 7.9 percent and was down nearly 15 percent on the year. Only 50.7 percent of condos and townhomes sold within 30 days in June, a dramatic slowdown from 83 percent a year ago and less than the 61.4 percent of single-family homes that sold within that same timeframe.



A Note on Median vs Average Home Sale Price


In general, the median sale price is the number that comes in the middle of a series of numbers, where half the numbers are lower and half are higher. In terms of real estate, the median price is the one where half of the homes sold in a market were cheaper and half were more expensive.


The average sale price is based on the total price of all homes sold during a period divided by the number of homes sold. While the median and average prices are sometimes close, they can also be significantly different depending on market conditions, market trends and dominant market segments, like starter vs. luxury homes, for instance.



Which Strategy is Right for You?


Every real estate transaction is different in terms of timing, financing and preferences. Work with your real estate agent to identify and understand the way your personal needs and requirements will impact your ability to negotiate and navigate your purchase or sale


Sellers Need to Rethink Pricing Strategies


For sellers, increased inventory and lower median list prices for homes without offers â down from $560,185 in May to $550,000 in June â means that pricing is more important than ever. During the heyday of the pandemic and post-pandemic market, low inventory levels meant that multiple offers and bidding wars were the norm. Now, however, more competition means more competitive pricing strategies.


At the same time, weâre seeing properties with correct pricing, and homes that are market-ready can still sell quickly and for a premium price. Sellers should work with their agent to identify needed repairs and value-added upgrades that can maximize the potential sale price of a property and ensure the best possible outcome for their home sale. Dont hesitate to contact Leslie Hoke for a free home evaluation on your property


Cash Buyers Are Still in Retreat





Cash deals continued to trend downward, making up only 23.1 percent of June sales, down from 26.6 percent a year prior. Fewer cash buyers generally suggests less interest from institutional or individual investors.


This trend could put a wrinkle in the plans of sellers who are operating under a time crunch, since cash buyers can generally close more quickly than those who require financing. This can affect your transaction in a number of ways:




Buyers who require financing may need to negotiate more aggressively or ask for more seller accommodations, such as repairs or closing cost assistance.


Buyers who require financing will need a longer time period for inspections and appraisals than investor buyers.


While the pool of existing investors is indeed able to close more quickly, they generally operate under strict pricing guidance, so sellers will need to be able to decide whether timeline or profit is a more compelling benefit.




Distressed Sales Are Rare These Days





Foreclosures and short sales are virtually nonexistent in the current market and comprised only 0.8 percent of June transactions. This is because as home values have risen over the past five years, most sellers operating under financial constraints have been able to sell or tap into their homeâs equity for solutions.


For all buyers, but especially investment buyers, this means that thereâs less opportunity to pick up a bargain in the current market. This may account, at least in part, for the reduced number of cash buyers, as well.


Overall, the numbers indicate that we are moving into a balanced market with a slow-motion shift toward an upcoming buyer-favored market. The good news? Thatâs not the same as a bubble or crash. Price erosion has been minimal, and demand for well-priced, well-maintained and favorably situated homes is still solid.


In addition, the luxury market has been a bright spot across the country and here in Las Vegas in particular, with ongoing strong demand and minimal disruption in market forces.


Buyers Should Act Decisively, But Not Impulsively


With more inventory and less pressure, itâs a good time to be a buyer. However, that doesnât mean itâs a good time for lowball offers or unreasonable negotiating tactics. Top-tier listings are still competitive, so a realistic understanding of the market youâre focusing on is imperative.


However, for the first time in a while, thereâs a reasonable expectation that you can find a home you like in a neighborhood that works for you and your household. Thatâs a big improvement over past years, and itâs definitely something to celebrate

This makes it an ideal area to move to if you enjoy living in a growing and vibrant urban environment that offers quiet neighborhoods with plenty of room to expand.


Henderson Mayor Michelle Romero comments on the population spike, stating, I am proud that Henderson offers the highest quality of life in the nation for cities of our size.

Henderson Community Neighborhoods





If youre moving to Las Vegas and choose Henderson as your home, know that youll have plenty of options when it comes to neighborhoods to choose from. Why is this the case? Being a larger urban area, the city is big enough to hold several thoughtfully designed master planned communities (MPCs).

Luxury on the Rise: A Strategic Look at the Las Vegas Housing Market â Spring 2025


Las Vegas real estate expert Leslie Hoke offers insights and opportunities in her spring market review and forecast.


For years, youâve heard the same story: Low inventory levels and elevated interest rates were creating a lock-in effect that kept sellers in place and caused buyer frustration. Now, however, the always-active spring market has brought some good news: Inventory is on the rise as prices remain strong, meaning a more balanced market for both buyers and sellers.


Whether youâre looking for the right time to put your home on the market or youâre looking for the right time to buy, this is the sign youâve been waiting for. Itâs been years since weâve seen such an ideal opportunity for a win-win outcome for your real estate goals. Letâs look at the forces driving the market, crunch the numbers and examine why now is the perfect time for exploring the Las Vegas luxury market in particular.


Here is a quick summary of topics we cover in this article:




Whats Driving the Current Las Vegas Market


Luxury Zip Codes to Watch


Spring Market Snapshot


Seller Strategies


Buyer Insights




Whatâs Driving the Current Las Vegas Real Estate Market?


There are a number of factors that, added together, are creating exceptional conditions for the Las Vegas housing market:


Population Growth: At 2.4 million, the Clark County population is up 50,000 year over year, a 2.1 percent increase. Along with this boost in population, weâve seen an attendant growth on the job front, with 17,000 jobs added in the past year.


Economic Expansion: Las Vegasâ productivity boom shows no signs of slowing, and gross domestic product (GDP) was up 8.8 percent on the year to a whopping $178.4 billion. Thatâs a 40 percent improvement over pre-pandemic levels.


Visitation and Entertainment: The twin linchpins of the Vegas economy held stable over the past year, even without the extra boost provided by the February 2024 Super Bowl. Thatâs good news for gaming, which was up slightly on the year, and great news for the second-home market.


Luxury ZIP Codes to Watch





For luxury homesellers, three ZIP codes stood out in Las Vegas Realtorsâ latest economic report:




89138 â Summerlin West: With a median income of $151,000 and a population increasing by 47 percent over the past decade and a half, the Summerlin West luxury market is one of the more consistently high-performing areas in the region. Search all homes in Summerlin


89135 â The Ridges: Here, in The Ridges youâll find a median income of $107,000 with 11 percent growth since 2010. LVRâs report shows ongoing strong home prices with low days on market for listings in this exclusive Summerlin community.


89141 â Southern Highlands: This always-popular area of Southern Highlands has experienced population growth of 29.3 percent during that same period, with a median income of $150,579. Here, too, youâll find solid home prices and quick turnaround times for properly priced and prepped listings




Increased Commercial amp; Infrastructure Development


In the wider area, commercial and infrastructure improvements slated for completion in 2025 include:




Venetian renovations valued at $1,300,000,000


Las Vegas Convention Center North, Central and South Exhibition Halls renovation valued at $600,000,000


UnCommons culinary hub valued at $400,000

City of Las Vegas Civic Plaza valued at $165,000,000


Area 15 expansion valued at $161,000,00




For luxury homebuyers and homeowners in the Las Vegas metro, the good news is that the latest numbers â population growth, jobs and development projects â are all going in the right direction: UP That makes Las Vegas real estate a solid, long-term play, whether for commercial investors or for homeowners who simply want to ensure the value of their single largest personal investment in the years to come.


Spring 2025 Las Vegas Market Snapshot


Sold ListingsÂ in March/April 2025


March/April 2025 Single-Family Home Sales





March 2025 Home Sales saw a modest 2.9 percent increase in the number of single-family homes sold year over year, but a significant 22.6 percent increase in the number of new listings. That translates to 2.5 months of effective inventory, up 58.4 percent from March 2024.


April saw dips in the number of units sold in Las Vegas, with single-family home sales dropping by 7.1 percent. Effective availability of 2.9 months represented significant year-over-year increases in inventory of over 92.


March/April 2025 Condo Sales





The March 2025 Condo Market the number of units sold dropped slightly (3.4 percent) on the year. New condo listings increased by 21.9 percent to 1,053 and the market held a jaw-dropping 3.9 months of effective inventory, up 93.5 percent from the same period last year.


April saw dips in the number of condo units sold by 12.4 percent on the year. Effective availability of 4.4 months, reflected an increase of over 118 from April 2024.


Overall Impact of Inventory Fluctuations


Interestingly, however, this increase in inventory didnât translate into significant price reductions, suggesting that much of the inventory increase is being absorbed by the market, which has been waiting impatiently for an opportunity to buy during the pandemic and post-pandemic years.


Average Prices in March/April 2025


March/April 2025Â Average Prices Single-Family Homes





In March 2025, average prices for single-family homes sold were up 3.1 percent on the month and 6.7 percent year over year.Â 


Average prices in April, however, saw slight dips in average sold prices, with single-family homes down 3.7 percent month over month, though still up for the year at 1.3 percent. (+2.3 for Median Home Prices)


March/April 2025Â Average Prices for Condos





In March, Average Condo prices were up 0.7 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, during the same period.


Average Condo prices in April were down 4 percent on the month and only 0.2 percent on the year. (+4.4Â for Median Condo Prices)


Impact of Price Changes


Ultimately, the numbers reflect the new reality: More options in terms of inventory mean a longer time on the market and more motivated sellers. This is being reflected in price adjustments during the negotiation period. However, sellers seem to be catching up to the new reality, especially those who waited until later in the spring to decide to list.


New Listings in March/April 2025


March/April 2025Â New Listings for Single-Family Homes








The average price of new listings in March was down 2.5 percent month-over-month for single-family homes, although that still represented a 4.9 percent increase year over year.


In April, however, the average price of new single-family listings held relatively steady, dipping only 0.4 percent on the month and increasing 4.3 percent on the year. (+7.2Â for Median New Listing Home Prices)


March/April 2025Â New Listings for Condos

In April, however the average list price for condos was down 9 percent on the month, though it increased slightly (2.1 percent) year over year. (+2.4 for Median New Listing Condo Prices)


Price Corrections in April


Thus, condo prices for new listing in particular, which might have been a bit too optimistic at the beginning of the spring market, corrected their pricing in April. Considering that upwards of 60 percent of homes overall were still selling within 30 days, buyer urgency still exists for the right listings.Â

Seller Strategies for the Las Vegas Market





For sellers hoping to stand out in the still-competitive Las Vegas market while holding down days on market and garnering the highest possible price for their listing, here are some strategies that are working right now:


Prep Right


This is not the time to skimp on the fundamentals, and buyers have more options than theyâve had in years. That means decluttering, repairs and updates. For sellers of luxury homes, staging can make all the difference between a home that shows its best and one that sits on the market. Luxury homebuyers are discerning, and with softening inventory, theyâll be expecting move-in-ready polish.


Price Right


This is not the time to test the market with an outsized asking price thatâs not supported by the market. Work with your agent on pricing right up to the day your home goes on the MLS, ensuring that youâre accounting for the latest changes in market conditions. This is especially important right now, since economic news out of D.C. can have an impact on buyer attitudes and subsequent price sensitivity.


Plan Right


If youâre selling and buying at the same time, youâre in a great position to find the home of your dreams among the current expanded inventory. Talk to your real estate agent and discuss the logistics of selling and buying all at once so that you can coordinate contingencies and closings on both sides of the transaction.

Buyer Insights for the Las Vegas Market





Buyers are in a better position than theyâve experienced in a long time. For buyers who were locked out of the hyper-competitive pandemic-era real estate market and whoâve been scared away by higher interest rates and home prices over the past few years, this is the first time weâve seen a significant opportunity to take advantage of more balanced market conditions. View all real estate for sale in Las Vegas


Prep Right


Donât wait until youâve found the perfect home to get your financial ducks in a row. Start working with a lender ahead of time to understand the mortgage process and begin gathering the documents and assets needed to get your mortgage through underwriting and get yourself to the closing table. If you need to sell your home before you buy, talk to your lender and your agent about your options, including relevant contingencies and bridge financing.


Price Right


With rising inventory, you may be in a position to negotiate better terms on your home purchase. Look for recent price drops or homes that have been on the market for more than 30 days in order to find sellers who may be motivated to make a deal. However, be cautious of low-ball offers, which can close the door to a negotiation immediately by insulting the seller.


Plan Right


The ups and downs of the mortgage market have made it tough to determine which financing option offers the best bet. Talk to your lender about locking in your rate before interest rates go up again, especially if there are economic indicators that suggest an upcoming rebound.

For luxury buyers, the ongoing lesson of the Las Vegas market is that location matters more than flash, and the best neighborhoods tend to hold their value for the long haul. Donât be dazzled by designer finishes or put off by details you donât love: Finishes can be changed, but location canât.


Spend some time visiting your likely neighborhoods to see if the vibe matches your personality and preferences. If possible, visit at different times of the day and week â early morning, evening, weekends and weekdays. Drive the commute, and check out the best local dining, shopping and entertainment venues. Get a well-rounded idea of the areas youâre interested in and use that to narrow your choices.


For sellers, presentation is everything. Donât overlook the details when youâre getting your home ready to show. Need help? Talk to your agent about contractors, designers, organizational experts and professional moving services to help you fix up, decorate and pack up so that your moving process is as seamless and stress-free as possible. Remember, the majority of homes in the area are still moving quickly, so getting ahead on prep and packing just makes sense.


Most of all, this is the time to get realistic about movements in the market. For the past several years, sellers have held all the cards, but now there are more options for buyers to choose from and, therefore, more of a need for flexibility. Talk with your agent about your expectations and develop a negotiation strategy before you go on the market. That will help you make decisions quickly, especially in the event of multiple offers with a variety of terms in play.
